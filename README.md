# Stock Market Game

## Overview

The Stock Market Game is a web-based application designed to help me learn how to utilize charts and graphs in JavaScript. This project simulates stock trading, allowing users to buy and sell shares while visualizing price fluctuations over time.

## Features

- **Interactive Trading**: Users can buy and sell shares with a simulated balance.
- **Dynamic Stock Prices**: Stock prices fluctuate randomly, mimicking real market behavior.
- **Real-time Charting**: Visualize stock price changes over time using Chart.js.
- **Data Export**: Download historical price data in JSON format.
- **Graph Reset**: Clear the chart and reset the historical data to start fresh.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Chart.js (for graphing)

## Purpose

This project serves as a practical learning tool to enhance my understanding of JavaScript, particularly in using libraries for data visualization. It provides an engaging way to experiment with concepts related to stock trading and financial markets.

## Getting Started
